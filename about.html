                <p class="intro-paragraph">
                    I'm a Biology and Aeronautical Engineering graduate. After having spent seven years in the U.K for my studies, I'm now in Paris pursuing an interdisciplinary master's degree at the Learning Planet Institute. I'm passionate about the intersection of biology and engineering, and to communicate these inspiring findings through creative practices. Currently, I'm a research intern in the MorphoDyn Lab under the supervision of Dr Annemiek Cornelissen. We are studying the swimming motion of jellyfishes thanks to deep learning.

                <p>
                    My academic journey in engineering has equipped me with [mention 1-2 key skills or areas of focus, e.g., "strong problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of mechanical systems"]. I particularly enjoy projects that [mention type of engineering projects, e.g., "challenge conventional thinking and allow for tangible, impactful results"].
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parallel to my technical pursuits, art, especially drawing and sketching, has always been a vital outlet for my creativity. It allows me to [mention what art does for you, e.g., "observe the world differently, experiment with form and emotion, and communicate ideas visually"]. I believe that the analytical mindset from engineering and the imaginative freedom of art complement each other, fostering a holistic approach to creation and problem-solving.
